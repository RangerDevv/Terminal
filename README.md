# Terminal
A FOSS web terminal


In order to start tailwindcss put in this command:``` npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch```

Credits to W3school for the draggable terminal code. https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_draggable.asp 

This is for a client!

Made in approximately 2 hours.
